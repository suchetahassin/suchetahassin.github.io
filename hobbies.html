<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <h4>My hobbies include playing the ukulele and watching series.</h4>
  <p>I was inspired to play the ukulele when I first started listening to Cavetown. I am still learning it and it's a good first instrument for anyone wiling to start playing an instrument.</p>

  <p>I enjoy watching different genres of tv shows, The Office being my favourite. Other really good tv shows that I have watched and would recommend is The Good Place and After Life.</p>
